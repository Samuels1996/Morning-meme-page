# Morning-meme-page

This Page is a meme page dedicated to being a morning meme page. 

Just wake up and want real or fake news and not be able to tell the difference while drinking your coffee?

Then the Daily Dashboard is going to be the page for you!

Try it out with the News, Weather, as well as inspirational quotes by two of the smartest men of this generation: Trump and Kanye!

This page is dedicated to being a morning refresher with laughs and uncertainty. 

This page was utilized using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.

During this project we were able to work as a team to accomplish the goal of creating a page to bring smiles to those every morning.

While visiting the page see if you are able to guess the right quotes!
